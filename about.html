    <p>Hello! I’m Fatima Shuaibu Tanko...</p>
      <p>  A passionate multitasker wearing many creative hats.
         I'm currently studying software engineering (yes, even though i don't love coding lol..), 
         driven by faith, vision, and belief that technology can open doors. Beyond the screen, 
         i'm a skilled tailor who finds joy in crafting beautiful pieces with my hands.
        I'm also a vibrant content creator, using storytelling, visuals, and voice to express ideas that inspire and connect.
    My journey might be unconventional, but every step reflect my boldness to try, to grow, and to show others that success
comes in many forms... NOT JUST CODE.  </p>
